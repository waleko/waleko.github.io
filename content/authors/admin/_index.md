Hi, my name is Alexander Kovrigin. I am a 2nd year Computer Science student at Constructor University, Bremen. I completed my high school education at the Physical-Technical High School in St. Petersburg, Russia. There, I was passionate about Physics, Mathematics, and Computer Science. I competed in national mathematics and informatics olympiads and took on pet projects during summer holidays.

After high school, I was admitted to the Higher School of Economics in St. Petersburg. I was top student of both semesters and completed coursework projects, including Cavoke -- a semester-long C++ project in a mentored team of three.

In 2022, I transferred to Constructor University Bremen, a English-speaking, international-focused university located in Bremen, Germany. I continue to compete in international olympiads such as IMC and NWERC (ICPC semi-final), where I placed in the top 20% as part of a team. I am also currently involved in a research work in applying machine learning methods to material science.

I am currently looking for an internship for summer 2023.
