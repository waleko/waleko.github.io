Hello, I'm Alexander Kovrigin, a third-year Computer Science student at Constructor University, Bremen. Currently interning at the ML4SE lab, JetBrains Research, my focus involves developing ML solutions for code editing tasks.

I'm proud to have secured a silver medal at NWERC 2023, placing within the top 6 teams overall, marking a milestone in my competitive programming journey. Additionally, last summer's First Prize award at IMC stands as a testament to my dedication in mathematics olympiads.

Thank you for visiting my website. I'm excited to share more about my evolving journey in the world of Computer Science and beyond.
