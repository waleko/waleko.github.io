Hello, I'm Alexander Kovrigin, currently in my third year of Computer Science studies at Constructor University, Bremen. Currently, my focus is on research that involves applying machine learning techniques to material science.

I participate in international olympiads like IMC, where I was honored with a First Prize award, and NWERC (ICPC semi-final), achieving a commendable place within the top 20% teams.

Thank you for visiting my website, and I look forward to sharing more about my journey in the world of Computer Science and beyond.
