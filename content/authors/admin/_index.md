Hello, I'm Alexander Kovrigin, currently in my third year of Computer Science studies at Constructor University, Bremen. I'm originally from St. Petersburg and have had an interesting educational journey so far.

I attended the Physical-Technical High School in St. Petersburg, where I developed a strong interest in Physics, Mathematics, and Computer Science. Participating in national mathematics and informatics olympiads, along with working on personal projects during summers, became my way of embracing these subjects.

After completing high school, I enrolled at the Higher School of Economics in St. Petersburg. I was fortunate to perform well academically, securing the top spot in both semesters. During this time, I also worked on coursework projects, notably contributing to a semester-long C++ project called Cavoke, which I completed alongside a dedicated team of three.

In 2022, I made the decision to transfer to Constructor University Bremen, where I could explore a more international and English-speaking environment. Continuing my academic journey, I participated in international olympiads like IMC, where I was honored with a First Prize award, and NWERC (ICPC semi-final), achieving a commendable place within the top 20% teams.

Currently, my focus is on research that involves applying machine learning techniques to material science. This research showcases my dedication to expanding the practical applications of my knowledge.

Thank you for visiting my website, and I look forward to sharing more about my journey in the world of Computer Science and beyond.
