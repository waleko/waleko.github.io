It comes with built-in solutions to solve many common-found problems associated with developing a multiplayer game.\nIf you are new to Cavoke, I would advise you to consult the documentation’s Introduction section.\nQuick Start Let’s look at the cavoke development using Tic-Tac-Toe game as an example. You can freely browse our final code on GitHub.\nClient-side First of all, let’s begin with our client component. We will delegate all the checking and validating to the server side, and only receive full board state and send cell clicks.\nWe will create a brand-new QML application:\nimport QtQuick 2.0 Rectangle { id: game width: display.width; height: display.height + 10 } Now let’s add the code for interacting with main cavoke application:\nimport QtQuick 2.0 Rectangle { // BEGIN cavoke section  Connections { target: cavoke function onReceiveUpdate(jsonUpdate) { console.log(\u0026#34;Received: \u0026#34; + jsonUpdate); // TODO: update board  } } // END cavoke section  id: game width: display.width; height: display.height + 10 } Now let’s add our board image and a grid with our small icons:\nimport QtQuick 2.0 import \u0026#34;content\u0026#34; Rectangle { // BEGIN cavoke section  Connections { target: cavoke function onReceiveUpdate(jsonUpdate) { console.log(\u0026#34;Received: \u0026#34; + jsonUpdate); // TODO: update board  } } // END cavoke section  id: game width: display.width; height: display.height + 10 Image { id: boardImage source: \u0026#34;content/pics/board.png\u0026#34; } Column { id: display Grid { id: board width: boardImage.width; height: boardImage.height columns: 3 Repeater { model: 9 Rectangle { // TODO: use a custom class  width: board.width/3 height: board.height/3 onClicked: { // TODO: send move  } } } } Row { spacing: 4 anchors.horizontalCenter: parent.horizontalCenter } } } Now let’s finally implement the logic. For this let’s create a separate content/interactions.js for move processing. It can look like this:\nfunction processResponse(response) { let res = JSON.parse(response) updateBoard(res[\u0026#34;state\u0026#34;]); } function sendMove(moveString) { let move = {} move.move = \u0026#34;X\u0026#34; + moveString cavoke.getMoveFromQml(JSON.stringify(move)) } function updateBoard(boardString) { for (let i = 0; i \u0026lt; 9; ++i) { board.children[i].state = boardString[i]; } } function gameFinished(message) { messageDisplay.text = message messageDisplay.visible = true } function resetField() { for (var i = 0; i \u0026lt; 9; ++i) board.children[i].state = \u0026#34;\u0026#34; } We will also create a custom TicTac class for our noughts and crosses:\n// FILE: content/TicTac.qml import QtQuick 2.0 Item { signal clicked states: [ State { name: \u0026#34;X\u0026#34;; PropertyChanges { target: image; source: \u0026#34;pics/x.png\u0026#34; } }, State { name: \u0026#34;O\u0026#34;; PropertyChanges { target: image; source: \u0026#34;pics/o.png\u0026#34; } } ] Image { id: image anchors.centerIn: parent } MouseArea { anchors.fill: parent onClicked: parent.clicked() } } Finally, our main app.qml looks now like this:\nimport QtQuick 2.0 import \u0026#34;content\u0026#34; import \u0026#34;content/interactions.js\u0026#34; as Interact Rectangle { // BEGIN cavoke section  Connections { target: cavoke function onReceiveUpdate(jsonUpdate) { console.log(\u0026#34;Received: \u0026#34; + jsonUpdate); Interact.processResponse(jsonUpdate); } } // END cavoke section  id: game width: display.width; height: display.height + 10 Image { id: boardImage source: \u0026#34;content/pics/board.png\u0026#34; } Column { id: display Grid { id: board width: boardImage.width; height: boardImage.height columns: 3 Repeater { model: 9 TicTac { width: board.width/3 height: board.height/3 onClicked: { Interact.sendMove(String(index)); } } } } Row { spacing: 4 anchors.horizontalCenter: parent.horizontalCenter } } Text { id: messageDisplay anchors.centerIn: parent color: \u0026#34;blue\u0026#34; style: Text.Outline; styleColor: \u0026#34;white\u0026#34; font.pixelSize: 50; font.bold: true visible: false Timer { running: messageDisplay.visible onTriggered: { messageDisplay.visible = false; Interact.resetField(); } } } } This is it for the client-side! You can browse the final code along with static assets on GitHub.\nServer-side As outlined in the documentation, we have to implement three http-methods. We will use our template repository for this. Now we only need to implement three methods in a C++ project.\nOur code is currently:\n#include \u0026#34;cavoke.h\u0026#34; namespace cavoke { bool validate_settings( const json \u0026amp;settings, const std::vector\u0026lt;int\u0026gt; \u0026amp;occupied_positions, const std::function\u0026lt;void(std::string)\u0026gt; \u0026amp;message_callback) { // TODO: Implement your game validation here  return true; } GameState init_state(const json \u0026amp;settings, const std::vector\u0026lt;int\u0026gt; \u0026amp;occupied_positions) { // TODO: Implement your game start here  return GameState{false, \u0026#34;\u0026lt;INIT_STATE\u0026gt;\u0026#34;, {}, {}}; } GameState apply_move(GameMove \u0026amp;new_move) { // TODO: Implement your game move event processing here  return GameState{false, \u0026#34;\u0026lt;GLOBAL_STATE\u0026gt;\u0026#34;, {}, {}}; } } // namespace cavoke Filling this out with our state structure, we can achieve code looking something like this:\n#include \u0026lt;sstream\u0026gt;#include \u0026#34;cavoke.h\u0026#34; namespace cavoke { …","date":1661385600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1661385600,"objectID":"0c6b9ac371714c38f9c873fb5456fc0b","permalink":"https://alexkovrigin.me/post/cavoke-game-quick-start/","publishdate":"2022-08-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/cavoke-game-quick-start/","section":"post","summary":"Hi 👋 In this quick tutorial I walkthrough how to create your first cavoke game","tags":["School","GameDev"],"title":"Creating a Cavoke Game","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Overview Problem formulation We believe that developing a desktop multiplayer game is always a great adventure that has many wonderful opportunities to learn something new along the way. However, in our opinion this journey, is often riddled with unnecessary challenges of implementing mechanisms that are common for many games. This includes:\n Developing a client application with many UI components for game creation process Networking, which in itself includes  Synchronizing the game state among clients Handling network issues on client’s side SSL and Security   Game state persistence Game move validation Role choosing (e.g. White/Black in Chess) Managing game sessions and shareable invites for friends to play with you Game and User statistics (win rate, total time spent, etc.) User Authentication and Authorization Game versioning Hosting server logic and scalability  To make these obstacles easier to avoid, we developed a framework for developing multiplayer turn-based board games that comes with built-in solutions to solve all the above-mentioned problems.\nOur solution We have developed a solution that works for many board games. Your board game can work with cavoke if:\n   Requirement Description     ✅ Is a board game Has a simple 2D interface. Game interface must be implementable using QML.   ✅ Is based on moves All changes during the game are based on the moves and updates that are representable as a string.   ✅ No race conditions If multiple players are eligible to move at the given moment, there is no guarantee that the first one to move will be recorded as such. However, there is a guarantee that the resulting game state is achieved via a valid subsequence of game moves.    Developers side Our platform provides an easy way for developers to create a desktop game. A developer should provide only two components:\n Server logic component that verifies one’s move correctness and updates the game state Client game component. A QML application that communicates with the main Cavoke Client application and sends player’s moves through this gateway. It also receives updates from other players’ moves to update its user interface.  You can read more about creating your own cavoke game on our Cavoke Game Template GitHub page that has been made to flatten the learning curve.\nPlayers side Furthermore, we provide many features in our cavoke client for the users. These include:\n Cross-platform: Available on Windows, macOS and Linux User Authentication using Email-Password or SSO via Google or GitHub Catalog of available cavoke games Rooms with shareable invites for your friends, so you can play multiple games without the need to change the app User’s statistics for every game Developer mode to test QML components locally     How To Use Please see the instructions for how to clone and build server and client components in its subdirectories.\n Server Client  Download You can download the latest installable version of Cavoke Client for Windows, macOS and Linux.\nCredits This software uses the following open source projects:\n Qt Drogon Circle Icons by Nick Roach Boost KArchive KDE Craft ECM jwt-cpp qtkeychain nlohmann/json Quassel  Credit to Mudlet and Markdownify for the README inspiration.\nLicense MIT\n  @MarkTheHopeful · @waleko · @petrtsv\n ","date":1656633600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1656633600,"objectID":"4f284ba303239c7530b80ed5029d74d7","permalink":"https://alexkovrigin.me/project/cavoke/","publishdate":"2022-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/cavoke/","section":"project","summary":"A Platform for creating and hosting multiplayer turn-based board games.","tags":["School","GameDev"],"title":"Cavoke","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"What is Wikirace Wikirace is a single-/multiplayer game about traversing links from one wikipedia page to another.\nPlayers are given two wikipedia page titles.
